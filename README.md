Overview
---
In this project, we trained a convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify traffic signs. The model was trained and validated using images from [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model was trained, images of German traffic signs found on the web were used to test and validate the model accuracy.

A writeup of the project was created detaling some asspect of the work done. 

To meet evaluation specifications of the project, the following three files were submitted: 
* the Ipython notebook with the code
* the code exported as an html file
* a writeup report either as a markdown or pdf file
