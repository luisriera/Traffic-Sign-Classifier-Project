Overview
---
In this project, a deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs was train. The model was trained and validated using images from [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model was trained, images of German traffic signs that you find on the web were used to test the model accuracy.

We also want you to create a detailed writeup of the project. Check out the [writeup template](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/writeup_template.md) for this project and use it as a starting point for creating your own writeup. The writeup can be either a markdown file or a pdf document.

To meet project evaluation specifications, the following three files were submitted: 
* the Ipython notebook with the code
* the code exported as an html file
* a writeup report either as a markdown or pdf file
