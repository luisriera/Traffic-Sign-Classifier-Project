Overview
---
In this project, a deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs was train. The model was trained and validated using images from [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model was trained, images of German traffic signs that you find on the web were used to test the model accuracy.

A detailed writeup of the project was created detaling some asspect of the work done, especialy with the tuning parameters. 

To meet project evaluation specifications, the following three files were submitted: 
* the Ipython notebook with the code
* the code exported as an html file
* a writeup report either as a markdown or pdf file
